 abstract = {In this paper we consider deflations inverse pocket flips of n-gons for small n. We show that every pentagon can be deflated after finitely many deflations, and that any infinite deflation sequence of a pentagon results from deflating an induced quadrilateral on four of the vertices. We describe a family of hexagons that deflate infinitely for a specific deflation sequence, yet induce no infinitely deflating quadrilateral. We also review the known understanding of quadrilateral deflation.},
