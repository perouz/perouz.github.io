 abstract = {In this paper we study polygonal transformations through an operation called deflation. It is known that some families of polygons deflate infinitely for given deflation sequences. Here we show that every infinite deflation sequence of a polygon P has a unique limit, and that this limit is flat if and only if exactly two vertices of P move (are reflected) finitely many times in the sequence.},
