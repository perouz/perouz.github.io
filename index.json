Under assumptions about the data-generative process, the causal graph can often be identified up to an equivalence class. Proposing new realistic assumptions to circumscribe such equivalence classes is an active field of research. In this work, we propose a new set of assumptions that constrain possible causal relationships based on the nature of the variables. We thus introduce typed directed acyclic graphs, in which variable types are used to determine the validity of causal relationships. We demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that the proposed assumptions can result in significant gains in the identification of the causal graph.","tags":[],"title":"Typing assumptions improve identification in causal discovery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bahare Fatemi","Perouz Taslakian","David Vazquez","David Poole"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643685860,"objectID":"4c5b7bc634c4cdf129c0d457bab5ca79","permalink":"https://perouz.github.io/publication/ijcai-2020-303/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T04:00:25.155056Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijcai-2020-303/","section":"publication","summary":"Knowledge graphs store facts using relations between two entities.

To overcome this, we introduce HSimplE and HypE, two embedding-based methods that work directly with knowledge hypergraphs. In both models, the prediction is a function of the relation embedding, the entity embeddings and their corresponding positions in the relation.

We define context as the products that are known to be compatible with each of these item.

Complete area coverage is the problem of moving an end-effector over all available space while avoiding existing obstacles. In such tasks, using multiple robots can increase the efficiency of the area coverage in terms of minimizing the operational time and increase the robustness in the face of robot attrition. Unfortunately, the problem of finding an optimal solution for such an area coverage problem with multiple robots is known to be NP-complete. In this paper we present two approximation heuristics for solving the multi-robot coverage problem. The first solution presented is a direct extension of an efficient single robot area coverage algorithm, based on an exact cellular decomposition. The second algorithm is a greedy approach that divides the area into equal regions and applies an efficient single-robot coverage algorithm to each region. We present experimental results for two algorithms. Results indicate that our approaches provide good coverage distribution between robots and minimize the workload per robot, meanwhile ensuring complete coverage of the area.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient multi-robot coverage of a known environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Mauroy","Perouz Taslakian","Stefan Langerman","Raphaël Jungers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643685859,"objectID":"dc079901b60134ce00503de1f59d216f","permalink":"https://perouz.github.io/publication/mauroy-2016-four/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T04:00:24.500424Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mauroy-2016-four/","section":"publication","summary":"A four-bar linkage is a mechanism consisting of four rigid bars which are joined by their endpoints in a polygonal chain and which can rotate freely at the joints (or vertices).

In this paper we consider the problem of reconfiguring a four-bar linkage using an operation called a emphpop. Given a polygonal cycle, a pop reflects a vertex across the line defined by its two adjacent vertices along the polygonal chain. Our main result shows that for certain conditions on the lengths of the bars of the four-bar linkage, the neighborhood of any configuration that can be reached by smooth motion can also be reached by pops.

It is known for all Yao graphs, with the sole exception of $Y_5$, whether or not they are geometric spanners. In this paper we close this gap by showing that for odd $k ≥ 5$, the spanning ratio of $Y_k$ is at most $1/(1-2sin(3Θ/8))$, which gives the first constant upper bound for $Y_5$, and is an improvement over the previous bound of $1/(1-2sin(Θ/2))$ for odd $k ≥ 7$. We further reduce the upper bound on the spanning ratio for $Y_5$ from $10.9$ to $2+ sqrt(3) ≈ 3.74$, which falls slightly below the lower bound of $3.79$ established for the spanning ratio of $Θ_5$ ($Θ$-graphs differ from Yao graphs only in the way they select the closest neighbor in each cone). This is the first such separation between a Yao and $Θ$-graph with the same number of cones. We also give a lower bound of $2.87$ on the spanning ratio of $Y_5$. In addition, we revisit the $Y_6$ graph, which plays a particularly important role as the transition between the graphs ($k  6$) for which simple inductive proofs are known, and the graphs ($k łeq 6$) whose best spanning ratios have been established by complex arguments. Here we reduce the known spanning ratio of $Y_6$ from $17.6$ to $5.8$, getting closer to the spanning ratio of 2 established for $Θ_6$. Finally, we present the first lower bounds on the spanning ratio of Yao graphs with more than six cones, and a construction that shows that the Yao-Yao graph (a bounded-degree variant of the Yao graph) with five cones is not a spanner.","tags":[],"title":"New and Improved Spanning Ratios for Yao Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oswin Aichholzer","Sang Won Bae","Luis Barba","Prosenjit Bose","Matias Korman","André van Renssen","Perouz Taslakian","Sander Verdonschot"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643685860,"objectID":"2aa92e1f7d28b110433747f1cae6a80e","permalink":"https://perouz.github.io/publication/aichholzer-14/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T04:00:26.385158Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aichholzer-14/","section":"publication","summary":" In this paper, we show that the $Θ$-graph with three cones is connected.

Specifically, we show how the structure of the Euclidean algorithm defines a family of rhythms which encompass over forty timelines (emphostinatos) from traditional world music. We prove that these emphEuclidean rhythms have the mathematical property that their onset patterns are distributed as evenly as possible: they maximize the sum of the Euclidean distances between all pairs of onsets, viewing onsets as points on a circle. Indeed, Euclidean rhythms are the unique rhythms that maximize this notion of emphevenness. We also show that essentially all Euclidean rhythms are emphdeep: each distinct distance between onsets occurs with a unique multiplicity, and these multiplicies form an interval $1,2,...,k−1$. Finally, we characterize all deep rhythms, showing that they form a subclass of generated rhythms, which in turn proves a useful property called shelling. All of our results for musical rhythms apply equally well to musical scales.

Depending on the part of the world in which they occur, such drawings have different names such as sona, kolam, and nitus drawings.

Motivated by this connection, we further our study to include analysis of some properties of sand drawings. In particular, we study the number of different drawings, show how to generate them, and show connections to the well-known Traveling Salesman Problem in computer science.","tags":[],"title":"Sand Drawings and Gaussian Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erik D.
