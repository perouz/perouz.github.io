 abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a variation of the well-studied Yao graphs.
Given a set of points $S⊂ ℝ^2$ and an angle $0 < Θ łeq 2π$,
we define the \emphcontinuous Yao graph $y̧ao$ with vertex set $S$ and angle $Θ$ as follows. For each $p,qın S$, we add an edge from $p$ to $q$ in $\a̧o$ 
if there exists a cone with apex $p$ and aperture $Θ$ such that $q$ is the closest point to $p$ inside this cone.},
